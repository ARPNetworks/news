ARP Networks, Inc., a VPS, dedicated server, and data center services provider for individuals looking to establish enterprise class infrastructure, this week proudly launched their new Data Center in Frankfurt, Germany.  After months of planning for the official launch and unveiling of their new presence, the full-service data center services provider celebrated the monumental milestone in their operation’s history.

“Having launched our entity in 1999, we felt it appropriate that we expand our business reach before we hit the 20 year mark in operation,” said Garry Dolley, Co-Founder and Owner of ARP Networks, Inc. “After months of planning, designing, and coordination, we are proud to announce the official launch of this new location for increased access to our services and infrastructure capabilities.”

Though a small team, ARP Networks represents a vast amount of individuals and high-profile clients worldwide whom are dedicated to efficiency and inter-connectivity. They chose Frankfurt, Germany as their new data center location for cross-European reach, by operating right out of the heart of Germany.

ARP Networks, Inc. sets itself apart from the competition by gladly supporting FreeBSD and OpenBSD, often regarded as second class citizens.  In addition, native IPv6 has been supported for 8 years and included with all services.  Lastly, they run their own network, which is fully multi-path redundant with over 70 directly connected peers.

“We pride ourselves on our ability to provide services that are nothing but top-notch and high-quality,” said Garry. “We make ourselves readily available to our clients, and focus on customer service above all else. Spread the word on the official opening of our new data center, and head on over to our platform to learn more about our services today.”
